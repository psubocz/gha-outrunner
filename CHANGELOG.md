# Changelog

## [1.1.1] - 2026-04-06

Minor bugfix release.

### Fixes

- Disable `PrivateTmp` in systemd service — libvirt provisioner creates qcow2 overlays in `/tmp` that QEMU needs to access outside the namespace
- Clarify Windows virtiofs mount requirements in docs: WinFsp install, `VirtioFsSvc` auto-start, default drive letter (Z:)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-04

### Features

- Docker provisioner: bind mounts (`mounts` field with `source`, `target`, `read_only` per entry)
- Tart provisioner: shared directories via `tart run --dir` (`mounts` field with `name`, `source`, `read_only` per entry)
- Libvirt provisioner: virtiofs host directory share (`mount` field with `source`; tag derived from basename; `memoryBacking`/`memfd` added to domain XML automatically)

Primary use case: persistent build cache shared across ephemeral runners without network round-trips.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-31
