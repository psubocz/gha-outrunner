# Architecture

outrunner is a single binary that bridges GitHub's scaleset API with local infrastructure: Docker containers, KVM virtual machines, or Tart VMs.

## System Overview

![Architecture diagram](../arch.png)

Each runner defined in the config gets its own scale set and listener. GitHub handles label matching and routes jobs to the appropriate scale set. outrunner does not perform any internal label routing.

## Components

### Listener

Each runner in the config gets its own listener that connects to GitHub's scaleset service via a long-polling message session. When jobs arrive or complete, GitHub sends messages through this channel. The listener delegates to the Scaler.

This uses the [actions/scaleset](https://github.com/actions/scaleset) Go library, which handles authentication, session management, and message parsing.

### Scaler

The Scaler implements the `listener.Scaler` interface from the scaleset library. It has three responsibilities:

1. **HandleDesiredRunnerCount:** GitHub says "I need N runners." The Scaler generates JIT configs and calls the provisioner's `Start` for each new runner needed. It never exceeds the runner's `max_runners` limit (which defaults to the `--max-runners` CLI flag).

2. **HandleJobStarted:** A runner picked up a job. Updates the runner's phase to Running.

3. **HandleJobCompleted:** A job finished. The Scaler calls the provisioner's `Stop` to tear down the environment.

The Scaler tracks active runners by name in a map, protected by a mutex. Each runner gets its own goroutine that manages the full lifecycle: provisioning, waiting for completion, stopping, and deregistration. On shutdown, the Scaler cancels the lifecycle context and waits for all goroutines to finish (with a timeout).

### Provisioners

Each provisioner implements a simple interface:

```go
type Provisioner interface {
    Start(ctx context.Context, req *RunnerRequest) error
    Stop(ctx context.Context, name string) error
    Close() error
}
```

The `RunnerRequest` carries the runner name, JIT configuration token, and the runner's provisioner configuration. Each provisioner uses these to create an environment and launch the runner process inside it.

See the [Provisioner Reference](../reference/provisioners.md) for details on each backend's lifecycle.

## Scale Set Lifecycle

1. **Startup:** outrunner creates one scale set per runner in the config, registering each with its declared labels. GitHub starts routing matching jobs to the appropriate scale set.

2. **Running:** Each listener long-polls for messages independently. GitHub sends desired runner counts based on queued jobs. outrunner provisions environments to meet demand (up to the per-runner `max_runners` limit).

3. **Shutdown:** On SIGINT, outrunner stops all running environments, deregisters runners from GitHub, and closes all message sessions. Scale sets are kept for reuse on next startup.

If outrunner crashes without cleanup, the stale scale sets persist. On next startup, outrunner detects them via get-or-create logic and reuses them. Each provisioner also cleans up orphaned environments from previous runs.

## Authentication Flow

```
PAT ──► scaleset.Client ──► Registration Token ──► Broker Session
                                                        │
                                                  Long-poll for messages
                                                        │
                                              JIT Config per runner
                                                        │
                                              Runner self-registers
                                              with GitHub on startup
```

The PAT is only used to create the scaleset client and generate JIT configs. It is never passed into containers or VMs. Each runner gets a short-lived JIT token that is valid for a single registration.

## Why Guest Agents Instead of SSH

The libvirt and Tart provisioners use guest agents (QEMU Guest Agent and Tart's built-in agent) instead of SSH or WinRM to execute commands inside VMs. This eliminates:

- **IP address discovery:** No need to wait for DHCP, query ARP tables, or configure static IPs.
- **Credential management:** No SSH keys or passwords to inject, rotate, or secure.
- **Network configuration:** The agent communicates over a host-guest channel (virtio-serial for QEMU, native for Tart), not the network.
- **Firewall concerns:** No ports to open. The channel is local to the hypervisor.

The tradeoff is that the guest agent must be installed in the base image, and the API is more limited than SSH (no interactive sessions, no file transfer). For running a single command (`run.sh --jitconfig ...`), it is more than sufficient.
